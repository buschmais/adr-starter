= 001 - Use Slf4j for Logging

== Status

Proposed

== Context

Proper logging of the processes taking place during runtime is crucial to understand and debug occuring issues in production.

This requires that logging is done uniformly to one place which requires that there is only one logging framework with one configuration used.

Currently, there are multiple ways to log implemented in the application.

== Decision

Use the Slf4j API for all logging.

== Consequences

For new code:

- Only use `org.slf4j.Logger` and `org.slf4j.LoggerFactory`

For existing code:

- Refactor all uses of other logging frameworks and calls to `System.out` and `System.err` to Slf4j
