= 003 - No Deep Links between Aggregates

== Status

Proposed

== Context

The upcoming switch from a relational to a document-based database technology for the catalog sub-domain requires the implementation of aggregates in the data model.

While those aggregates can be identified manually, it's required that there are no deep links between different aggregates.

An entity linked to by two aggregates as depicted in the figure would thus violate the requirement.

== Decision

Each entity must only be referenced in one aggregate, i.e. by one aggregate root and not by entities from outside the aggregate.

Following constructs must therefore be avoided:

* An Entity which is referenced by two or more Aggregate Roots
* An Entity which is referenced by an Entity which is not part of the same Aggregate

For easier identification of classes that represent an Aggregate Root, they will be annotated with `org.jqassistant.contrib.plugin.ddd.annotation`.

== Consequences

* Existing Code
** All Aggregate Roots in the data model of the catalog sub-domain (`com.salesmanager.catalog`) must be identified and marked as such
** All violations must be identified and fixed
* New Code
** If a new Aggregate Root is introduced, it needs to be marked as such
** Deep Links from one Aggregate to another must not be added. Aggregates may only reference each other via Aggregate Roots.
