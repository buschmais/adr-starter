== Introduction

This document contains all Architecture Decision Records made for this application.

[quote, 'https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture_decision_record[Joel Parker Henderson]']
An architectural decision record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences.
An architectural decision (AD) is a software design choice that addresses a significant requirement.

== Working with ADRs

=== Template

The file `template.adoc` contains a template for ADRs:

.ADR Template
....
include::template.adoc[]
....

=== Creating an ADR

If you want to propose a new architecture decision, follow the following process (in a separate branch):

1. Copy the ADR template to a new document named <XXX>-<Title>.adoc
2. Fill all sections of the ADR
3. Present the ADR to a selection of the team and have it discussed
4. Update the ADR based on the discussions and create a PR
5. Have the PR reviewed and merged (Note: the state needs to be changed to Accepted)

=== Updating an ADR

If there need to be changes to an existing ADR, following actions are possible depending on the change:

1. Updating an existing document
** Existing ADRs may be updated for minor changes that do not affect the decision itself, e.g.
*** Correcting spelling errors
*** Updating rules that validate the decision because of source code changes
** In that case, update the ADR in a separate branch, create a PR, have it checked and merged
2. Superseding an existing document
** In case a decision is not valid anymore for the project, the document needs to be marked as superseded
*** If there is a successor for this decision, follow the process for creating a new ADR and link the superseded one
*** If there are rues validating this decision, disable them by updating the ADR
** If everything is accomplished, get the changes reviewed in a PR and have it merged
